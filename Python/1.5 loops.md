# ✅ 1) What is a Loop?

A loop is used to **repeat a block of code** multiple times.

Example:
✅ print numbers 1 to 10
✅ run a task 100 times
✅ iterate a list of users

---

# ✅ 2) `for` Loop ✅

Used when you know **how many times** to repeat (or you are iterating a list/range).

---

## ✅ A) `for` with `range()`

### ✅ Example: Print 1 to 5

```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)
```

✅ Output:

```
1
2
3
4
5
```

### ✅ `range(start, stop)`

* start is included ✅
* stop is excluded ❌

---

## ✅ B) Print 1 to 10

```python
for i in range(1, 11):
    print(i)
```

---

## ✅ C) Step in range (jump)

```python
for i in range(1, 11, 2):
    print(i)
```

✅ Output:

```
1
3
5
7
9
```

---

## ✅ D) Loop through a List

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "mango"]

for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

---

# ✅ 3) `while` Loop ✅

Used when you repeat **until a condition becomes False**.

### ✅ Example

```python
i = 1

while i <= 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1
```

---

# ✅ 4) `break` and `continue`

---

## ✅ `break` (stop loop immediately)

```python
for i in range(1, 10):
    if i == 5:
        break
    print(i)
```

✅ Output:

```
1
2
3
4
```

---

## ✅ `continue` (skip this iteration)

```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    if i == 3:
        continue
    print(i)
```

✅ Output:

```
1
2
4
5
```

---

# ✅ 5) Loop + Condition Example ✅

Print even numbers from 1 to 10:

```python
for i in range(1, 11):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        print(i)
```

✅ Output:

```
2
4
6
8
10
```

---

# ✅ 6) Nested Loop (Loop inside Loop)

Used in patterns, tables, matrix, etc.

```python
for i in range(1, 4):
    for j in range(1, 4):
        print(i, j)
```

✅ Output:

```
1 1
1 2
1 3
2 1
2 2
2 3
3 1
3 2
3 3
```

---

# ✅ Practice Tasks ✅ (Must Do)

## ✅ Task 1: Print 1 to 20

```text
1 2 3 ... 20
```

---

## ✅ Task 2: Print Even numbers 1 to 50

Output should contain only even numbers.

---

## ✅ Task 3: Sum of 1 to N

Take input `N` from user and calculate sum.

Example:

```
Enter N: 5
Sum = 15
```

---

## ✅ Task 4 (Real one 🔥): Multiplication Table

Take a number input and print table:

Example:

```
Enter number: 5
5 x 1 = 5
5 x 2 = 10
...
5 x 10 = 50
```
